## How to Run on Your Own Machine

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arsdeep/Prompt-ly.git
   cd Prompt-ly
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   If you are using Python 3, you can create a virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the Requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create the Secrets Configuration**

   Create a directory named `.streamlit` in the root of the project if it doesn't exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir .streamlit
   ```

   Inside the `.streamlit` directory, create a file named `secrets.toml`:

   ```bash
   touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```

   Open `secrets.toml` and add your API keys:

   ```toml
   [general]
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key_here"
   COSTAR_PROMPT = "your_costar_prompt_here"
   ```

   Replace `"your_gemini_api_key_here"` and `"your_costar_prompt_here"` with your actual API key and prompt.

5. **Run the App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
